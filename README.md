## MTN Cote D'Ivoire data analysis
### Project description
MTN Cote d’Ivoire is one of Africa’s leading telecommunications companies. For years this company has been facilitating mobile transmissions, radio, and television broadcasts across Cote d’Ivoire and has gained a huge market where 80% of mobile users and those who own radios and televisions utilize their telecom services. In addition, their profits have been steadily increasing through the years as a result of their wide clientele. However, as of last year, the reputable company has been facing competition from new but successful telecom companies which have implemented modern and efficient telecommunications resources and technologies for mobile users such as 5G networks, which are taking the world by storm. 
 
As a data scientist here at MTN Cote d’Ivoire, my team has been tasked with collecting, cleaning, and analyzing all possible datasets concerning changing technology trends as well as customer needs and preferences to ensure that this company maintains its well-established reputation and prove to the world that it deserves the title of ‘leading telecommunication company in Africa.
